# History
The request for a ClickHouse Metabase driver is formulated in [Metabase issue #3332](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/3332). Some impatient ClickHouse users started development. The Metabase team is asking driver developers to publish plug-ins and collect some experiences before considering a PR, so here we are.

This driver is based on the following PRs:
* [metabase#8491](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/8491)
* [metabase#8722](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/8722)
* [metabase#9469](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/9469)
