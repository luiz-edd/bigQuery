# Project Overview

This project sets up an integrated environment for data visualization and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, combining Metabase with ClickHouse support and Airbyte for data synchronization. It includes several Dockerized services to provide a comprehensive data pipeline infrastructure.

- **Metabase** is customized with a ClickHouse plugin to enable powerful data visualizations.
- **Airbyte** is used for flexible data integration and syncing across different databases and APIs.
- **CloudBeaver** offers a database management interface.
- **ClickHouse** serves as a high-performance database optimized for analytical queries.

The project is fully containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale. Key components like PostgreSQL and ClickHouse are integrated, allowing the system to efficiently handle large volumes of data. The included scripts facilitate automatic database population and configuration, ensuring a smooth setup process.

This setup provides a seamless data pipeline for processing, managing, and visualizing complex data flows.

# Project Setup

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the project, which includes Metabase with ClickHouse integration, Airbyte, and other related services.

## 1. Build Docker Image for Metabase with ClickHouse

Navigate to the `repos/metabase-clickhouse-driver` directory and build the Docker image with the ClickHouse plugin:

```bash
./build_docker_image.sh v0.50.26 1.50.2 my-metabase-with-clickhouse:v0.0.1
```

This command integrates the ClickHouse plugin into Metabase, enabling visualization support.

## 2. Create and Run Airbyte Container

Navigate to the `repos/airbyte-0.52.0` directory and start the Airbyte container:

```bash
./run-ab-platform.sh
```

This command sets up the Airbyte container.

## 3. Configure and Start Docker Services

1. Create your own `.env` file using `.env_sample` as a template.
2. Run the following command inside the `docker/` directory to start the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## 4. Verify Container Status and Obtain IP Address

1. Check if all containers are running by inspecting the Docker network:

    ```bash
    docker network inspect docker_default
    ```

2. Copy the IPv4 address of the PostgreSQL container. Update the `host` variable in `scripts/populate.py` on the host machine with this address. For example:

    ```python
    host="172.18.0.3"
    ```

## 5. Run the Populate Script

Execute the Python script to populate the database:

```bash
python3 populate.py
```
